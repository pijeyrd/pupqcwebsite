                    <i class="fa fa-align-center" aria-hidden="true">Polytechnic University of the Philippines Quezon City (abbreviated as PUPQC; also known as PUP Commonwealth Campus) is one of the satellite campuses of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines located in Commonwealth, Quezon City, Philippines. It was established in 1997. It confers undergraduate and diploma degrees.</i>         
                    <br></br>
                    <i class="fa fa-align-center" aria-hidden="true">PUPQC was established through the generosity and benevolence of Walter Rothlehner, a German church leader who donated his property in Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City to PUP. The campus lot with an area of 1.9 hectares is donated by SIKHAY, an association led by Rev. Fr. Joel Tabora. The PUP Open University was tasked to administer and maintain the campus and its facilities.</i>

As enshrined on the Deed of Assignment on 24 March 1997, that is, “to establish a branch or an extension of PUP at the National Government Center with a mandate to bring quality education and subsidized tuition fees to the urban poor communities of Quezon City, with priority given to those from the NGCHP.” Since its establishment in 1997, PUP Quezon City continues to produce quality and globally competitive graduates in the areas of education, information technology, management, marketing, entrepreneurship and office management technology. Likewise, true to the University’s mandate as Pamantasan ng Bayan, its graduate degree thru the Open University education system increased by offering two additional programs including the first program offering as practical alternative venue from PUP Main Campus.</i>

                <i class="fa fa-align-center" aria-hidden="true">With the ongoing infrastructure project "REHABILITATION/RENOVATION OF MULTI-PURPOSE BUILDING AT PUP QC", another promise delivered project from the Office of Cong. Ralph Wendel P. Tulfo, Quezon City's 2nd District Representative headed by Atty. Joren Lex A. Tan, Chief of Staff, is the construction of a 4-storey Academic Building.
                    The visit from the DPWH Quezon City First District Engineering Office yesterday guarantees that the project will commence soon this year once the requirements are completed. 
                    Considering the state of public tertiary education, such a project is a big help for the campus with the insufficiency of classrooms. 
                    Again, our sincere gratitude for a Bago, Progresibo at Walang Korupsyon infrastructure development project inside the PUP Quezon City Campus that is responsive to the needs of the academic community!!</i>
